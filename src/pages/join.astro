        <h2>Do you find yourself chronically building things? Same here.</h2>
        <p>Whether you&rsquo;re hunting for your next big project or just want something fun to tinker with on weekends, Mosaiq has a spot for you. We welcome coders, designers, dreamers, and anyone who loves to create.</p>
        <h3>What we look for</h3>
        <p>Required:</p>
        <p>&bull; 18+ years of life experience</p>
        <p>&bull; A brain full of ideas (good, bad, or gloriously weird)</p>
        <p>&bull; Curiosity and a hunger to learn new skills</p>
        <p>&bull; The itch to build things just because you can</p>
        <p>Nice to have:</p>
        <p>&bull; Web dev experience (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, etc.)</p>
        <p>&bull; An eye for design or UX</p>
        <p>&bull; Experience with software or game development</p>
        <p>Why join?</p>
        <p>Because you&rsquo;ll get real project experience: the kind you can put on a resume, brag about in interviews, or just show off to your friends. No grades. No payroll. Just the joy of building something awesome and the skills you&rsquo;ll pick up along the way.</p>
        <p>How to join</p>
        <p>Skip the fancy applications. Just shoot us an email at join@mosaiq.dev with your resume or portfolio and a quick hello. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

        <h2>Smallprint</h2>
        <p>Mosaiq is a nonprofit, member-run organization. This is not a full-time job or a paid position. Instead, it&rsquo;s a side commitment where you can gain real project experience, collaborate with others, and build meaningful software.</p>
        <p>A few important notes:</p>
        <p>&bull; Compensation: None. Any revenue Mosaiq generates is reinvested into operations or directed toward charitable initiatives such as scholarships.</p>
        <p>&bull; Time Commitment: This is a part-time, flexible opportunity. Members are expected to balance Mosaiq with classes, work, and other obligations.</p>
        <p>&bull; Visa Sponsorship: We cannot sponsor work visas or provide employment authorization.</p>
        <p>What we&rsquo;re really looking for in candidates:</p>
        <p>&bull; A genuine interest in building, learning, and experimenting with software.</p>
        <p>&bull; Reliability. People who follow through and contribute consistently.</p>
        <p>&bull; Collaboration skills. An openness to feedback, willingness to help teammates, and a drive to build together.</p>
        <p>&bull; Creativity and curiosity. Whether you&rsquo;re coding, designing, or brainstorming, we want members who bring energy and ideas.</p>
        <p>In short: if you&rsquo;re looking for a paycheck, Mosaiq isn&rsquo;t for you. If you&rsquo;re looking for experience, community, and the chance to make a real impact through code, you&rsquo;ll fit right in.</p>
